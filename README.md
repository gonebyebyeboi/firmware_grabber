# UNDER DEVELOPMENT

There are requirements for this parser to work, but I haven't created the README as of yet.
This parser is designed to grab firmware image names from resulting scans from the EMBA Firmware analysis tool.

The Grabbers are ordered in Marks, meaning mark one is the first attempt. Second mark is the second attempt, and so on.
