# firm_grabber
There are requirements for this parser to work, but I haven't created the README as of yet.

The Grabbers are ordered in Marks, meaning mark one is my first attempt. Second mark is my second attempt, and so on.
I tried to implement new methodologies of getting the information I needed, with more luck with some than others.
