# INCOMPLETE PROGRAM

This program is designed to run as a parser for the EMBA Firmware Analysis tool. It parses through completed scan files for HTML files, looking for Hex GUIDs that correlate with the name of the firmware that was scanned if it is not provided in the original EMBark report. This is a universal tool and will need to be tweaked for it to work with other systems.

The Grabbers are ordered in Marks, meaning mark one is the first attempt. Second mark is the second attempt, and so on.
